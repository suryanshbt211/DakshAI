##  Multi-Agent Architecture

DakshAI uses **9 autonomous agents**, with tasks distributed as follows:

###  Academic Design Agents
| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 1. Policy Parser Agent | Extracts rules for design, assessment, conduct, and analytics from institutional policies |
| 2. Syllabus Generator Agent | Designs a weekly syllabus table aligned with policy constraints and learning goals |
| 3. Question Generator Agent | Produces assessments aligned with Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy, outcomes, and assessment policy |

###  Peer Reviewer Agents
| Agent | Specialization |
|--------|----------------|
| 4. Peer Reviewer #1 | Conceptual Accuracy and Depth |
| 5. Peer Reviewer #2 | Grammar, Clarity, Communication |
| 6. Peer Reviewer #3 | Rubric and Policy Compliance |
| 7. Peer Reviewer #4 | Critical Thinking and Reasoning |
| 8. Peer Reviewer #5 | Creativity and Problem Solving |
| 9. Peer Reviewer #6 | Growth Mindset and Student Development |

Each reviewer uses a shared rubric but evaluates from a different lens to ensure **multi-perspective grading**.
